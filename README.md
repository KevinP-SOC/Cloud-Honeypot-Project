# Home SOC in Azure (Cloud Honeypot)

## Objective
I built an intentionally exposed honeypot in Azure to see how the public internet actually probes a host in real time. The purpose was to practice cloud deployment and end-to-end telemetry: stand up a VM, wire logs into a SIEM (Log Analytics + Microsoft Sentinel), and capture clean endpoint data with Sysmon. The goal was to turn unsolicited scans/brute-force traffic into actionable detections and investigations—write KQL/SIEM rules, triage incidents, pivot across entities (IP, account, process), and document guardrails (NSGs, budgets, auto-shutdown) so the lab stays safe and affordable. In short: deploy a realistic target, observe real attacks, and build the detection/response  a SOC analyst needs.

### Skills Learned
- Practical understanding of cloud-based SIEM operations using Log Analytics and Microsoft Sentinel (data connectors, tables, incidents).
- Proficiency writing and tuning KQL to investigate authentication failures, brute-force patterns, and process activity at scale.
- Ability to interpret unsolicited internet telemetry (scans, RDP/SSH brute force) and separate noise from actionable signals.
- Experience building detections and visualizations (analytics rules, workbooks, geo-mapping via watchlists) to surface attacker trends.
- Stronger grasp of Azure networking and security controls (NSGs, public IP exposure, VM/agent health) and their effect on telemetry.
- Endpoint instrumentation skills with Sysmon and Azure Monitor Agent, validating field quality, timestamps, and host identity.
- Improved incident triage, enrichment, and tuning discipline—reducing false positives while keeping high-fidelity alerts.


### Tools Used
- **Azure**: Resource Groups, Virtual Network/Subnet, **Network Security Groups (NSG)**, Public IPs, **Log Analytics Workspace**, **Microsoft Sentinel**, Defender for Cloud.
- **Windows Server / Windows 10** (honeypot VM) or **Ubuntu** (for SSH bait).
- **Sysmon** + **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** for endpoint telemetry into Log Analytics.
- **Microsoft Sentinel** (or **Splunk** if forwarding) for analytics rules, incidents, and dashboards.
- **PowerShell/Bash** for setup checks
-  **nmap** for external reachability tests.

## Steps
`[Images need to be uploaded]`
1) **Create Resource Group, Virtual Network, and Subnet**  
![Ref 1 – RG + VNet + Subnet](LINK_TO_IMAGE_1)  
*Ref 1:* Create a dedicated Resource Group and a Virtual Network with a lab Subnet to keep everything organized and isolated.

2) **Begin VM Creation (Basics Tab)**  
![Ref 2 – VM Basics](LINK_TO_IMAGE_2)  
*Ref 2:* Select the image (Windows/Ubuntu), size, admin username/password (or SSH key), and accept licensing. Use a small SKU to control costs.

3) **Networking: Attach the VM to Your Lab VNet**  
![Ref 3 – VM Networking](LINK_TO_IMAGE_3)  
*Ref 3:* Ensure the the VM is placed on the previously created VNet/Subnet. Leave defaults unless you need a specific NIC name or public IP.

4) **Advanced/Management Tabs (Leave Defaults)**  
![Ref 4 – Defaults Acknowledged](LINK_TO_IMAGE_4)  
*Ref 4:* For this lab, leave most options as-is. You can revisit boot diagnostics, identities, and extensions later if needed.

5) **Disable Boot Diagnostics (Lab Setting)**  
![Ref 5 – Boot Diagnostics Off](LINK_TO_IMAGE_5)  
*Ref 5:* Turn off boot diagnostics for simplicity/cost in this lab. (Optional; keep enabled if you want serial console logs.)

6) **Review + Create → Deploy VM**  
![Ref 6 – Review + Create](LINK_TO_IMAGE_6)  
*Ref 6:* Validate settings, click **Create**, and wait for deployment to finish. Then navigate to the new Resource Group.

7) **Open the VM’s NSG**  
![Ref 7 – NSG in Resource Group](LINK_TO_IMAGE_7)  
*Ref 7:* In the Resource Group, open the Network Security Group (NSG) tied to the VM NIC or subnet to manage inbound/outbound rules.

8) **Remove Default RDP Rule (Cleanup)**  
![Ref 8 – Remove RDP Rule](LINK_TO_IMAGE_8)  
*Ref 8:* Delete the default RDP inbound rule to avoid confusion before adding your lab’s intentional exposure rule.

9) **Add an “Allow All Ports” Inbound Rule (Honeypot Only)**  
![Ref 9 – Allow * Ports](LINK_TO_IMAGE_9)  
*Ref 9:* Add a new inbound rule: Source = Any, Destination = Any, **Port ranges = “*”**, Protocol = Any, Action = Allow.  
⚠️ **Warning:** This is intentionally insecure for honeypot telemetry. Never use in production.

10) **Confirm NSG Rule Order and Effect**  
![Ref 10 – NSG Updated List](LINK_TO_IMAGE_10)  
*Ref 10:* Verify the new rule sits above any deny rules so it actually takes effect.

11) **Copy the VM’s Public IP**  
![Ref 11 – Public IP](LINK_TO_IMAGE_11)  
*Ref 11:* Grab the public IP for RDP/SSH testing and later external scans.

12) **Remote Desktop / SSH to the VM**  
![Ref 12 – RDP Client](LINK_TO_IMAGE_12)  
*Ref 12:* Open **Remote Desktop Connection** (Windows) or SSH (Linux/macOS). Enter the public IP and authenticate with the admin credentials you set.

13) **Initial OS Setup**  
![Ref 13 – First Login](LINK_TO_IMAGE_13)  
*Ref 13:* Complete the initial Windows setup (privacy, updates). For honeypot purposes, keep things simple.

14) **Disable Windows Defender & Firewall (Lab Only)**  
![Ref 14 – Disable Defender/Firewall](LINK_TO_IMAGE_14)  
*Ref 14:* Open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** → **Windows Defender Firewall Properties** → Turn off Domain/Private/Public profiles.  
⚠️ **Lab Only:** This is to maximize observable telemetry. Re-enable for any environment you care about.

15) **Verify External Reachability from Host**  
![Ref 15 – Ping/Reachability](LINK_TO_IMAGE_15)  
*Ref 15:* From your host, test reachability (ping if allowed, or `nmap -Pn -p <port> <public-ip>`). You should see the VM responding.

16) **Generate Failed Logons for Telemetry**  
![Ref 16 – Purposely Fail Logon](LINK_TO_IMAGE_16)  
*Ref 16:* Log off and intentionally enter wrong credentials several times to create **4625** failed logon events.

### Notes
- **Honeypot Warning:** Steps 9 and 14 intentionally reduce security to attract activity. Keep this VM isolated and never reuse credentials.  
- **Costs:** Use small SKUs, budgets, and auto-shutdown to control spend.  
- **Cleanup:** Tear down the Resource Group when finished or keep it only with strict cost guardrails.  
- **Video:** Add your end-to-end walkthrough link here → `[Add Video Link Here]`.

---

### Notes
- This honeypot is **deliberately exposed**—keep it isolated from anything you care about.
- Use strong creds/keys and never reuse passwords.
- Tear down the environment when you’re done, or keep budgets/auto-shutdown enabled.
